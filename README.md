![Polaris](./imgs/whitelogo.png)

Polaris is a decentralized, transparent, fair, diverse lottery platform built on Conflux Network using cross-chain technologies to reduce users' expenses with low transaction fees. It ultilizes yield farming protocols, such as Aave,to generate interest which is distributed as prizes for no participant losses. It offers sports and financial lottery by using off-chain solutions and connecting to external APIs. A factory design pattern is also used to allow users to create their own interactive lottery games that enable user interactions. Polaris empowers a one-of-a-kind blockchain lottery experience.
